Chapter 1


There are things that are within my control, and 🐈‍⬛ which are not.


Within my control are...


My opinions about 🐈 🐈‍⬛,


Whether I aim to be a good cat caretaker,


Whether I desire the perfect pet, 


And whether I am annoyed by the fact that my perfect pet has claws that I need to avoid.


Beyond my control or what the cat does to my body,


How often Mr. Kitty uses my property as a scratching post,


Having a reputation as a cat person


And whether the cat decides to hire me or fire me from my job as his personal lap.


In other words, I don't control the cat.


The things that I control, like my opinions and decisions,


Are always there, and I can have them whenever I want.


The things I don't control, like how often Mr. Kitty wants to sit and purr on my lap, depends entirely on Mr. Kitty.


I can't have Mr. Kitty do what I want, when I want, because I don't control him. He is a cat.


If I think freedom is the ability to make this cat do what I want, even though cats by nature can't be controlled,
