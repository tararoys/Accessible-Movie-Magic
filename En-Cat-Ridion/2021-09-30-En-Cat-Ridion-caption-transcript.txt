Chapter 1


There are things that are within my control, and 🐈‍⬛ which are not.


Within my control are...


My opinions about 🐈 🐈‍⬛,


Whether I aim to be a good cat caretaker,


Whether I desire the perfect pet, 


And whether I am annoyed by the fact that my perfect pet has claws that I need to avoid.
