<p> Chapter 1</p>
<p> There are things that are within my control, and 🐈‍⬛ , which are not.</p>
<p> Within my control are...</p>
<p> My opinions about 🐈 🐈‍⬛,</p>
<p> Whether I am to be a good cat caretaker,</p>
<p> Whether I desire the perfect pet, </p>
<p> And whether I am annoyed by the fact that my perfect pet has claws that I need to avoid.</p>
<p> Beyond my control are what the cat does to my body,</p>
<p> How often Mr. Kitty uses my property as a scratching post,</p>
<p> Having a reputation as a cat person,</p>
<p> And whether the cat decides to hire me or fire me from my job as his personal lap.</p>
<p> In other words, I don't control the cat.</p>
<p> The things that I control, like my opinions and decisions,</p>
<p> Are always there, and I can have them whenever I want.</p>
<p> The things that I don't control, like how often Mr. Kitty wants to sit on my lap, depends on Mr. Kitty.</p>
<p> I can't have Mr. Kitty do what I want what I want because I don't control him. He is a cat.</p>
<p> If I think freedom is the ability to make a cat do what I want, even though cats by nature can't be controlled,</p>
<p> I'm setting myself up for a world of anger, disappointment, and cat scratches.</p>
