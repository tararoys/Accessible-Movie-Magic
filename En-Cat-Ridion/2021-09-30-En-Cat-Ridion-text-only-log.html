<p> Chapter 1</p>
<p> There are things that are within my control, and üêà‚Äç‚¨õ , which are not.</p>
<p> Within my control are...</p>
<p> My opinions about üêà üêà‚Äç‚¨õ,</p>
<p> Whether I am to be a good cat caretaker,</p>
<p> Whether I desire the perfect pet, </p>
<p> And whether I am annoyed by the fact that my perfect pet has claws that I need to avoid.</p>
<p> Beyond my control are what the cat does to my body,</p>
<p> How often Mr. Kitty uses my property as a scratching post,</p>
<p> Having a reputation as a cat person,</p>
<p> And whether the cat decides to hire me or fire me from my job as his personal lap.</p>
<p> In other words, I don't control the cat.</p>
<p> The things that I control, like my opinions and decisions,</p>
<p> Are always there, and I can have them whenever I want.</p>
<p> The things that I don't control, like how often Mr. Kitty wants to sit on my lap, depends on Mr. Kitty.</p>
<p> I can't have Mr. Kitty do what I want what I want because I don't control him. He is a cat.</p>
<p> If I think freedom is the ability to make a cat do what I want, even though cats by nature can't be controlled,</p>
<p> I'm setting myself up for a world of anger, disappointment, and cat scratches.</p>
<p> But if I respect the limits of my control, and realize the cat is a cat,</p>
<p> Then I will be happy with however much lap time I get, </p>
<p> Pleased to have a companion that makes me take regular breaks from work,</p>
<p> And learn to see the advantages and having a very fuzzy, very reliable alarm clock at 5 AM.</p>
<p> So when any aspiring cat philosopher is confronted by unwanted cat behavior,</p>
<p> They should say to themselves, nobody died an appointed me a ruler of all cats.</p>
<p> Then examine what's going on by this simple rule:</p>
<p> Are you trying to control yourself or your cat?</p>
<p> If it's yourself? Excellent you've learned the first rule of philosophy.</p>
<p> If it's your cat? Best of luck. You're going to learn the hard way that there's a lot of things in this world that you don't control.</p>
<p> And this is the lesson for today.</p>
