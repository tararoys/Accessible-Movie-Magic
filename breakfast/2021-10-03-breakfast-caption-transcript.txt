My morning potato.


Morning tea.


Continuing to eat the potato. We're working our way through it.


I'm going to microwave myself another batch of tea.


It's time to start doing the breakfast dishes.


Here's my sink of dishes that need to soak for a while.


A bunch of Tupperware mugs and silverware sitting on a wooden drying rack.


I lost track of what I was doing and forgot to put over the top rack before I started stacking wet dishes on the bottom rack.


The kitty was looking up at me with soulful eyes.  And there he goes again.
