<p> Eating a microwave baked potato for breakfast.  The potatoes half eaten in a ceramic bowl and smeared with ketch-up.</p>
<p> I have drank 2 cups of tea this morning. I'm not sure what kind. I think it's lemon zinger.</p>
<p> Continuing to eat the potato.</p>
<p> Microwaving another batch of tea</p>
<p> It's time to start doing the breakfast dishes.</p>
<p> A sink full of dishes and dishes soap. Lots of mugs are hidden under the water.</p>
<p> A bunch of Tupperware silverware and some mugs sitting on a wooden drying rack.</p>
<p> Drying dishes and already dry dishes mixed together on the wooden drying rack.</p>
<p> A black cat sitting on the floor looking up at me with soulful eyes</p>
<p> I hear my Internet friends talking and I want to chat them up instead of finishing the dishes so I'm going to do that.</p>
<p> My Internet friends are working so I am going to work as well.</p>
