<p> Eating a microwave baked potato for breakfast.  The potatoes half eaten in a ceramic bowl and smeared with ketch-up.</p>
<p> I have drank 2 cups of tea this morning. I'm not sure what kind. I think it's lemon zinger.</p>
<p> Continuing to eat the potato.</p>
<p> Microwaving another batch of tea</p>
