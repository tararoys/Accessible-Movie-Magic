I right click on the folder anywhere inside it and paste knausj_talon-master to the user directory.


Now I have the scripts I need installed.


Back to Firefox and hit the back button to return to my installation instructions.


I install conformer using Talon speech recognition menu as my next step.


To find a Talon speech recognition menu I go down to the Talon icon, click on it go to speech recognition and go to install conformer.
