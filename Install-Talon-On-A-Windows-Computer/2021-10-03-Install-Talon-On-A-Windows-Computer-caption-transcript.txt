I right click on the folder anywhere inside it and paste knausj_talon-master to the user directory.


Now I have the scripts I need installed.


Back to Firefox and hit the back button to return to my installation instructions.


I install conformer using Talon speech recognition menu as my next step.


To find a Talon speech recognition menu I go down to the Talon icon, click on it go to speech recognition and go to install conformer.


It is easy to tell if a speech recognition system was installed because the subtitles begin appearing across the bottom.


Talon will start doing strange things because it comes turned on and command mode enabled. To turn off command mode go to speech recognition and sleep.


I can tell Talon is in sleep mode because the icon has a slash through it.


I have successfully installed Talon on a Windows 10 computer.


To get started learning Talon, go to the side bar on the Talon documentation website and click the link 'Learning Talon.'


The Talon practice website is a good place to go for beginners.
