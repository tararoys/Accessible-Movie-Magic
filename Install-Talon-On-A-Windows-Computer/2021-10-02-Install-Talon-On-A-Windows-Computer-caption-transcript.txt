I'm going to install the voice control software Talon.


Talon is software that allows you to control your computer entirely without hands.


Talon has a free version, and the free version allows you to do everything that you need to do entirely without hands.


I'm going to install that free version on my Windows computer today.


First, I'm going to go talonvoice.com.


Then I am going to go to the documentation link.


Then I am going to go to the getting started link.


Time to start following the instructions.


Download and install Talon for your operating system.


I right click and open this link in new tab to go to the download page.


I am going to download Talon for windows, and I am going to press the save file button.


I go to my downloads folder and select talon-windows.exe


A window will pop up asking me if I want to allow this app to make changes to my device.


I press yes.


The welcome to Talon setup wizard appears.


Welcome to Talon setup. Setup will guide you through the installation of Talon.
