<p> I right click on the folder anywhere inside it and paste knausj_talon-master to the user directory.</p>
<p> Now I have the scripts I need installed.</p>
<p> Back to Firefox and hit the back button to return to my installation instructions.</p>
<p> I install conformer using Talon speech recognition menu as my next step.</p>
<p> To find a Talon speech recognition menu I go down to the Talon icon, click on it go to speech recognition and go to install conformer.</p>
