<p> I'm going to install the voice control software Talon.</p>
<p> Talon is software that allows you to control your computer entirely without hands.</p>
<p> Talon has a free version, and the free version allows you to do everything that you need to do entirely without hands.</p>
<p> I'm going to install that free version on my Windows computer today.</p>
<p> First, I'm going to go talonvoice.com</p>
<p> Then I am going to go to the documentation link.</p>
<p> Then I am going to go to the getting started link.</p>
<p> Time to start following the instructions.</p>
<p> Download and install Talon for your operating system.</p>
<p> I right click and open this link in new tab to go to the download page.</p>
<p> I am going to download Talon for windows, and I am going to press the save file button.</p>
<p> I go to my downloads folder and select talon-windows.exe</p>
<p> A window will pop up asking me if I want to allow this app to make changes to my device.</p>
<p> I press yes.</p>
<p> The welcome to Talon setup wizard appears.</p>
<p> Welcome to Talon setup. Setup will guide you through the installation of Talon.</p>
<p> Recommended that you close all other applications before starting to set up. This will make it possible to update relevant system files without having to reboot your computer. Click next to continue.</p>
<p> I am going to click I agree to the license because I cannot have the software without agreeing.</p>
<p> Choose install location. Setup an install Talon in the following folder. To install a different folder click browse and select another folder. Click next to continue.</p>
<p> The destination folder is C:\Program Files\Talon, I do not want to change that, so I am going to press the next button.</p>
<p> Next screen is the choose start menu folder.</p>
<p> This screen allows me to select the start menu folder where all the useful Talon shortcuts go.</p>
<p> So I am not going to change anything.</p>
<p> I clicked the install button.</p>
<p> Talon begins installing.  Seems like a fairly fast process.</p>
<p> Talon has successfully installed on my computer.</p>
<p> The last screen the install wizard shows is the completed Talon setup.</p>
<p> I click the finish button.</p>
<p> I am now on step two: run the Talon app.</p>
<p> I go to the search bar and type talon.</p>
<p> Then I click on the Talon app.</p>
<p> Talon has launched.  It is difficult to tell, however, because the 'Talon is on' icon is this icon down here in the lower right hand corner.</p>
<p> Step 3 is to open the Talon Home Directory.</p>
<p> There are many ways of doing this.</p>
<p> On windows my preferred way is to go to the Talon icon, go to scripting, and open ~/Talon.</p>
<p> This opens the Talon home directory.</p>
<p> The next step is to add some scripts to the Talon home directory user folder.</p>
<p> Talon is incredibly customizable.</p>
<p> You can use Talon to set any English voice phrase to any action on your computer.</p>
<p> There are other languages and other input methods that Talon accepts, but since I am an English speaker and I use English words, that's what I need Talon to do for me the most.</p>
<p> As the instructions say, your user scripts control all of the voice commands in Talon.  So Talon won't recognize any commands until you add some scripts.</p>
<p> I'm going to the getting scripts section.</p>
<p> There is one script set that is currently recommended to install.</p>
<p> Knauj Talon script set, started by Jeff Knauh, and maintained by about a dozen Talon users.</p>
<p> It is one of the biggest, most robust, and least buggy scripts that's currently available and, by default, it is the recommended script set to install.</p>
<p> To install it I go to the Jeff Knaus Github repository.</p>
<p> I click on the green code button.</p>
<p> I click download zip.</p>
<p> It asks 'What should Firefox do with this file?  I wish to save scripts set.</p>
<p> I go to the download button in Firefox...</p>
<p> ...and I click open knausj.</p>
<p> I want to move this folder into my Talon home directory user folder.</p>
<p> Click on the file knausj_talon-master and press copy.</p>
<p> I go down to windows file explorer,</p>
<p> find the Talon Home directory,</p>
<p> I click on the user directory.</p>
<p> I right click on the folder anywhere inside it and paste knausj_talon-master to the user directory.</p>
<p> Now I have the scripts I need installed.</p>
<p> Back to Firefox and hit the back button to return to my installation instructions.</p>
<p> I install conformer using Talon speech recognition menu as my next step.</p>
<p> To find a Talon speech recognition menu I go down to the Talon icon, click on it go to speech recognition and go to install conformer.</p>
<p> It is easy to tell if a speech recognition system was installed because the subtitles begin appearing across the bottom.</p>
<p> Talon will start doing strange things because it comes turned on and command mode enabled. To turn off command mode go to speech recognition and sleep.</p>
<p> I can tell Talon is in sleep mode because the icon has a slash through it.</p>
<p> I have successfully installed Talon on a Windows 10 computer.</p>
<p> To get started learning Talon, go to the side bar on the Talon documentation website and click the link 'Learning Talon.'</p>
<p> The Talon practice website is a good place to go for beginners.</p>
<p> The Talon practice website assumes that you are using the  knausj talon repository</p>
<p> If you go through the lessons in order, it will teach you most of the very basics you need to know to get started controlling your computer entirely hands-free.</p>
<p> If you have any questions or run into problems with this installation process go talonvoice.com, chat, and join the Talon slack.</p>
<p> For basic installation questions, I recommend the #help channel.</p>
