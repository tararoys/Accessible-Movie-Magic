<p> I right click on the folder anywhere inside it and paste knausj_talon-master to the user directory.</p>
<p> Now I have the scripts I need installed.</p>
<p> Back to Firefox and hit the back button to return to my installation instructions.</p>
<p> I install conformer using Talon speech recognition menu as my next step.</p>
<p> To find a Talon speech recognition menu I go down to the Talon icon, click on it go to speech recognition and go to install conformer.</p>
<p> It is easy to tell if a speech recognition system was installed because the subtitles begin appearing across the bottom.</p>
<p> Talon will start doing strange things because it comes turned on and command mode enabled. To turn off command mode go to speech recognition and sleep.</p>
<p> I can tell Talon is in sleep mode because the icon has a slash through it.</p>
<p> I have successfully installed Talon on a Windows 10 computer.</p>
<p> To get started learning Talon, go to the side bar on the Talon documentation website and click the link 'Learning Talon.'</p>
<p> The Talon practice website is a good place to go for beginners.</p>
<p> The Talon practice website assumes that you are using the  knausj talon repository</p>
<p> If you go through the lessons in order, it will teach you most of the very basics you need to know to get started controlling your computer entirely hands-free.</p>
<p> If you have any questions or run into problems with this installation process go talonvoice.com, chat, and join the Talon slack.</p>
<p> For basic installation questions, I recommend the #help channel.</p>
