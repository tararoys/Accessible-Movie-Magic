<p> Chapter 2</p>
<p> Desire to watch a television show demands space to watch the television show.</p>
<p> Aversion to being interrupted provokes annoyance when the cat parks his fuzzy butt in front of the screen.</p>
<p> She who fails to catch a television show is disappointed</p>
<p> And she who is persistently blocked by the cat is wretched.</p>
<p> If ,then you want only those things that are in your control, you will not care if the cat interrupted your television show.</p>
<p> But if you want to have an uninterrupted viewing experience, or never have the flu, or just have a cuddly parts of the cat, you will be miserable.</p>
<p> But if you want an uninterrupted  television experience,</p>
<p> or to avoid getting clawed by the cat until you feed him,</p>
<p> or in general have life go the way you want,</p>
<p> He's not gonna let you have a very fun time.</p>
<p> Remove the habit of wanting the cat to act like anything but a cat,</p>
<p> and or that matter try to control what you want,  or you might end up like him... meowing for hours to try and get me to feed him an extra serving.</p>
<p> (Because after all, it worked once, right?)</p>
<p> Sadly, he is very disappointed.</p>
<p> But there is something that you could never be disappointed in,</p>
<p> and that is your ability to do a good job with the circumstances you're given.</p>
<p> Eventually Mr. Kitty will stop meowing and curl up on a nice warm couch,</p>
<p> and he can be smugly proud of having to put up with an annoying human all day.</p>
<p> On the other hand, getting rid of your wants does not mean that you magically remove what you need.</p>
<p> So don't use philosophy as an excuse to starve yourself to death or neglect cleaning yourself or finding an income.</p>
<p> But you can look for all of those things without putting too much pressure on yourself if you don't get them.</p>
