<p> Chapter 3</p>
<p> There are times when the cat will be adorable and sit on your chest for hours. </p>
<p> It's worth remembering that these moments will end, probably soon, based on the flicking tail.</p>
<p> These adorable moments are good practice.</p>
<p> Practice in enjoying the warm fuzzy goodness while it's happening.</p>
<p> And practicing dealing with the sadness when it's over. </p>
<p> It's good to practice on small moments like this.</p>
<p> To remind oneself to appreciate the fluffy lap when it happens.</p>
<p> And that all things eventually end.</p>
<p> Including the lives of both humans and cats.</p>
<p> If you sharpen your skills on small moments like a cat sharpens his claws on the banister,</p>
