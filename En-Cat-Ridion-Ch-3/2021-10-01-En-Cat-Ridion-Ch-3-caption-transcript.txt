Chapter 3


There are times when the cat will be adorable and sit on your chest for hours.


It's worth remembering that these moments will end, probably soon, based on the flicking tail.


These adorable moments are good practice.


Practice in enjoying the warm fuzzy goodness while it's happening,


And practicing dealing with the sadness when it's over.


It's good practice on small moments like this.


To remind oneself to appreciate the fluffy lap when it happens.


And that all things eventually end.


Including the lives of both humans and cats.
