<p> How do I uninstall software using the command line in Linux</p>
<p> What do I do if I need to uninstall a program?</p>
<p> I want to uninstall Talon</p>
<p> I think it might be as simple as the leading with Talon folder</p>
<p> I want to see if Talin is installed is a package on Linux anywhere</p>
