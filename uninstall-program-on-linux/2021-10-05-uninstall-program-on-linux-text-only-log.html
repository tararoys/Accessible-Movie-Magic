<p> How do I uninstall software using the command line in Linux</p>
<p> What do I do if I need to uninstall a program?</p>
<p> I want to uninstall Talon</p>
<p> I think it might be as simple as the leading with Talon folder</p>
<p> I want to see if Talin is installed is a package on Linux anywhere</p>
<p> I'm going to use the dpkg command to lust all of the packages and the search for the word Talon with grep</p>
<p> So I can assume that Talin is not an installed package.</p>
<p> So I think the process for uninstalling Talin from a Linux machine is as simple as removing the Talon folder with all the code and the  .talon folder with all the user configuration.</p>
<p> So I remove talon and I remove .talon from
my home directory, and I think that uninstalls Talon from my computer</p>
<p> is the process for uninstalling Talon from a Linux machine as simple as deleting the Talon with all of Talon's code directory and the .talon directory with all the user scripts and recordings and such?</p>
<p> if you're just trying to take a video of first setup, you need to sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/10-talon.rules as well (you don't need to do that otherwise)</p>
<p> OK in theory I am all set up to reinstall Talon.</p>
