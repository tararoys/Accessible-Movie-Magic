How do I uninstall software using the command line in Linux


What do I do if I need to uninstall a program?


I want to uninstall Talon


I think it might be as simple as deleting the Talon folder.


I want to see if Talon is installed as a package on Lenix anywhere


And I got no results searching for the word talon with grep


So I can assume the Talon is not an install package which makes sense since I didn't install it through a package manager
