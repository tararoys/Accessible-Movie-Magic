How do I uninstall software using the command line in Linux


What do I do if I need to uninstall a program?


I want to uninstall Talon


I think it might be as simple as deleting the Talon folder.


I want to see if Talon is installed as a package on Lenix anywhere


And I got no results searching for the word talon with grep


So I can assume the Talon is not an install package which makes sense since I didn't install it through a package manager


So I think uninstalling Talon is a simple as removing the Talon folder and the doc talon folder since Talon is not installed through a package manager.


So I no longer see Talon or .talon in my home directory, and they were there before.


is the process for uninstalling Talon from a Linux machine as simple as deleting the Talon with all of Talon's code directory and the .talon directory with all the user scripts and recordings and such?
