<p> The black cat glaring at me because I am not paying sufficient attention to him.</p>
<p> If you are working from home remind yourself that you are working in the same house the cat lives.</p>
<p> The black cat contentedly purring because he's having his head scratched.</p>
<p> The cat glaring at me again because I am not sufficiently scratching his head</p>
<p> The cats claws partially on she used to" in my shirt.</p>
<p> Cat sitting contentedly on lap.</p>
<p> And so I will more safely go to work if I stay to myself...</p>
<p> The cats sprawled across my lap.</p>
<p> And when the cat sits in my lap for an hour during the middle of a workday...</p>
<p> Cat still lying contentedly on my lap</p>
<p> And I can choose to be irritated that the cat wants attention now or I can learn to go with the flow</p>
<p> Kitty curled up even harder in my lap</p>
<p> Kitty cat still on the lap</p>
