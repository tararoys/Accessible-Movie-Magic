I'm going to install Talon on my Linux machine.


Talon is a program that allows me to control my computer entirely without hands.


This is important to me because my hands don't work very well and I use a computer for my job so being able to use a computer without hands means I have a lot less pain throughout the day.


The first thing I do is go to my web browser and go to talonvoice.com


Then I go to the documentation link.


After that I go to the getting started section.


I start reading the instructions in the getting started section.


Step one: download and install Talon for your operating system.


There is a link in step one and I click it so I can go to the page where it says download Talon for Linux.


I click download Talon for Linux.


I am going to open talon-linux.tar.xz and I am going to open it with the archive manager. I press OK.


There is one folder in the archive and I am going to extract it to my desktop.
