<p> I'm going to install Talon on my Linux machine.</p>
<p> Talon is a program that allows me to control my computer entirely without hands.</p>
<p> This is important to me because my hands don't work very well and I do my job on my computer so being able to use my computer without hands means that I have a lot less pain throughout the day.</p>
<p> The first thing I do is go to my web browser and go to talonvoice.com</p>
<p> Then I go to the documentation link.</p>
<p> After that I go to the getting started section.</p>
<p> I start reading the instructions in the getting started section. </p>
<p> Step one: download and install Talon for your operating system.</p>
<p> There is a link in step one and I click it to go to the page where I can download Talon for Linux.</p>
<p> I click download Talon for Linux.</p>
<p> A window appears saying opening talon-linux.tar.XZ I am going to open with archive manager.</p>
<p> There is one folder in the archive so I am going to extract it to my desktop.</p>
<p> Extracting to desktop now.</p>
<p> Talon is now on my desktop.</p>
<p> The talon folder opens in it or five files.</p>
<p> I go back to my instructions.  They say step two: run the Talon app.</p>
<p> I need to do run.SH in order to run Talin</p>
<p> Talon starts setting itself up.</p>
<p> You can tell Talon is set up when a little pair of horns appears in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.</p>
<p> Now I need to go to step three: open the talon home directory. Talon has a menu in the system tray near the clock, and I can use scripting â€“> open ~/Talon as a shortcut to open the Talon Home directory.</p>
<p> The next step is to add some Scripps to the ~/.Talon/user directory. Users Scripts control all of the voice commands in Talon, so Talon won't recognize any commands until you add some scripts.</p>
<p> To get Scripts I go to the getting Scripts link.</p>
<p> The next thing is to get the kausj_talon script set.</p>
<p> The knausj_script set started life as the personal script set of Jeff knaus and is now maintained by a dozen heavy Talon  users.</p>
<p> When you're on the knausj repo, click on the green code button.</p>
<p> Copy the link to the repository that pops up go to your command line</p>
<p> Open the terminal</p>
<p> Go to the home directly in the terminal.</p>
<p> Change the user directory.</p>
<p> In the user directly type get a clone and then the address http://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon.git</p>
<p> In the use of direct retype and get clonehttp:s\\gethub.com\knausj The yayyy The five\knausj The interse got talent that kid</p>
<p> Now I can move on to step 4: installing conformer using Talon's speech recognition menu.</p>
<p> To install conformer,  go to the Talon icon, click speech recognition, and click install conformer.</p>
<p> The talent icon may turn into a no sign or a circle I</p>
<p> At this point it's best to restart Talon to give everything a fresh start.</p>
<p> Subtitles may start appearing at the bottom of the screen and that means Talon successfully installed and is starting to respond to your voice commands. At this point you might want to say Talon sleep to make Talon stop responding to your commands.</p>
<p> To restart talon again go to the Talon folder and double click run.sh, and double click run in terminal.</p>
<p> Now that you have talon installed, the next thing you want to do is learn Talon.  Go back to the Docs and click the learning Talon link.</p>
<p> They tell him practice page he'll give you practice learning Talin.</p>
