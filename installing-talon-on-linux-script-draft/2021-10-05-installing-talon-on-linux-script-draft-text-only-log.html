<p> I'm going to install Talon on my Linux machine.</p>
<p> Talon is a program that allows me to control my computer entirely without hands.</p>
<p> This is important to me because my hands don't work very well and I do my job on my computer so being able to use my computer without hands means that I have a lot less pain throughout the day.</p>
<p> The first thing I do is go to my web browser and go to talonvoice.com</p>
<p> Then I go to the documentation link.</p>
<p> After that I go to the getting started section.</p>
<p> I start reading the instructions in the getting started section. </p>
<p> Step one: download and install Talon for your operating system.</p>
<p> There is a link in step one and I click it to go to the page where I can download Talon for Linux.</p>
<p> I click download Talon for Linux.</p>
<p> A window appears saying opening talon-linux.tar.XZ I am going to open with archive manager.</p>
<p> There is one folder in the archive so I am going to extract it to my desktop.</p>
<p> Extracting to desktop now.</p>
<p> Talon is now on my desktop.</p>
