<p> I'm going to install Talon on my Linux machine.</p>
<p> Talon is a program that allows me to control my computer entirely without hands.</p>
<p> This is important to me because my hands don't work very well and I do my job on my computer so being able to use my computer without hands means that I have a lot less pain throughout the day.</p>
<p> The first thing I do is go to my web browser and go to talonvoice.com</p>
<p> Then I go to the documentation link.</p>
