<p> I'm going to install Talon on my Linux machine.</p>
<p> Talon is a program that allows me to control my computer entirely without hands.</p>
<p> This is important to me because my hands don't work very well and I do my job on my computer so being able to use my computer without hands means that I have a lot less pain throughout the day.</p>
<p> The first thing I do is go to my web browser and go to talonvoice.com</p>
<p> Then I go to the documentation link.</p>
<p> After that I go to the getting started section.</p>
<p> I start reading the instructions in the getting started section. </p>
<p> Step one: download and install Talon for your operating system.</p>
<p> There is a link in step one and I click it to go to the page where I can download Talon for Linux.</p>
<p> I click download Talon for Linux.</p>
<p> A window appears saying opening talon-linux.tar.XZ I am going to open with archive manager.</p>
<p> There is one folder in the archive so I am going to extract it to my desktop.</p>
<p> Extracting to desktop now.</p>
<p> Talon is now on my desktop.</p>
<p> The talon folder opens in it or five files.</p>
<p> I go back to my instructions.  They say step two: run the Talon app.</p>
<p> I need to do run.SH in order to run Talin</p>
<p> Talon starts setting itself up.</p>
<p> You can tell Talon is set up when a little pair of horns appears in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.</p>
<p> Now I need to go to step three: open the talon home directory. Talon has a menu in the system tray near the clock, and I can use scripting â€“> open ~/Talon as a shortcut to open the Talon Home directory.</p>
<p> The next step is to add some Scripps to the ~/.Talon/user directory. Users Scripts control all of the voice commands in Talon, so Talon won't recognize any commands until you add some scripts.</p>
<p> To get Scripts I go to the getting Scripts link.</p>
<p> The next thing is to get the kausj_talon script set.</p>
